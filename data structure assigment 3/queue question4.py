Why FIFO creates trust in healthcare:

Perceived Fairness

In a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) system, patients are served in the exact order they arrive.

Everyone can clearly see that those who came earlier are treated before those who arrived later.

This transparency builds confidence that the process is not biased or arbitrary.

Reduces Conflict and Anxiety

If a later patient were treated first without medical justification, earlier patients might feel ignored or discriminated against.

FIFO reduces disputes, jealousy, or frustration among waiting patients, lowering stress in already tense healthcare environments.

Predictability

Patients know their position in the queue and can roughly estimate when they will be attended to.

This predictability gives them peace of mind and makes the system appear organized and reliable.

Ethical Responsibility

Healthcare is not only about treatment, but also about justice and dignity.

Serving patients in arrival order (except emergencies) shows respect for everyoneâ€™s time and rights.

This reinforces trust that the system values every patient equally.

Exception Handling (Emergencies)

Even when a priority system is applied (e.g., triaging emergencies), clear communication about why someone is prioritized ensures trust is maintained.

FIFO is the default, and deviations are ethically explained.

Conclusion:
FIFO creates trust in healthcare because it ensures fairness, transparency, , and respect for patients. When patients believe the system is just and unbiased, they are more cooperative, less anxious, and more confident in the care they receive.
