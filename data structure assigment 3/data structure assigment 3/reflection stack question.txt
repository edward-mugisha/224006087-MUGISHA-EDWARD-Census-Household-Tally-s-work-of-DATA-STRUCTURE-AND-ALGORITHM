Why stack cannot model patient queues

Nature of Service Order

A stack follows LIFO (Last-In, First-Out): the last person who comes is the first one to be served.

But in a hospital patient queue, service must be FIFO (First-In, First-Out): the patient who arrived earlier should be served before those who arrived later.

Fairness & Ethics

Using a stack would mean new patients always get served before older ones, leaving early arrivals waiting indefinitely.

This is unfair and unethical in healthcare, where order of arrival (or urgency) should matter.

Practical Consequence

Imagine 10 patients waiting. If a stack was used, the 10th patient would always be served first, and the 1st patient might never be treated.

This contradicts the real-world requirement for orderly and fair processing.

Correct Structure

A queue is the correct model for patients because it ensures FIFO order.

In special cases (like emergencies), hospitals may use priority queues to let critical patients "jump the line" â€” but never a stack.

 Conclusion:
A stack cannot model patient queues because its LIFO discipline is unfair and impractical for patient service. A queue (FIFO) or sometimes a priority queue is the appropriate data structure for healthcare scenarios.
